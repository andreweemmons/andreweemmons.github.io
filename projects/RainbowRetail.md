Rainbow Retail is an app that I created with a group in order to demonstrate Meteor, React, and Semantic UI skills learned throughout the semester taking ICS 314 (Software Engineering I). The app was built and designed by myself, and four other team members. We each assigned one other different portions to work on, and put everything together as we progressed. We demonstrated our capabilities of using Github, Meteor Application Frameworks, and technical coding abilities such as JavaScript in this project. It gave us a glimpse of what is to come in working in a real work environment, when assigned a project and a specific due date.

The app, Rainbow Retail, is a way that UH Manoa students can connect with one another to buy and sell things as students come and go from the campus. The app requires you to create an account, which is stored in a MongoDB, to access the rest. Once you are logged in, you can view all the items that are posted by other users, with descriptions and such. If you find an item that you like, you can message the other user in order to set up a way to obtain the item. If you would like to sell an item, you can post an item on the Post Item page, which allows you to create an item for other users to see. We also include a categories page, which sorts everything into separate categories. 

Overall, this app has allowed myself and others to work with teams, and focus on specific problems in order to combine them to create an overall app. I like working with other people, because you can focus more on a specific section and learn more in depthly that way. My experience using Meteor and React has been awesome, because of the fact that they are both modern and up to date. It creates a much nicer way to create a product versus hard coding in Javascript, CSS, and HTML. All in all, I hope to continue my journey of creating applications, and learning more about React.js and Meteor. They allow a lot of versatility, and the ability to make something look more modern. I also hope to work on something like this applicable to real life, and pursue a career that involves myself using what I learned to design apps.
