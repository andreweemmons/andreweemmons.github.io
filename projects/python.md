This is a random number project I coded in python. The concept behind this is when you run "python random313.py" you will get a random number. If you run "python random313.py 5" you will get a random number between 1 and 5. If you run "python random313.py 1 1000" you get a random value between 1 and 1000. Running "-s somevalue" after "python random313.py‚Äù gives a random string of length somevalue. Running "-c somevalue1 -s somevalue2" gives somevalue1 permutations of string of length somevalue2. Running "-p" follow by a set a strings, like "hello world" prints the strings word by word in the console.


The graph, uses matplotlib in python to show a count of running the program 1000 times, and getting 1000 random numbers between 0 and 100.
