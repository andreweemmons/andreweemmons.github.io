<h2>Reflection</h2>

	
  To begin, this semester in ICS 414, we learned a lot more about how certain languages such as ReactJs, MeteorJs, and
  Semantic UI can be impactful, for real world applications, as well as being able to collaborate with a team while 
  working on a group project. We were able to expand our skills on being able to collaborate on a group project with a 
  team, and separate issues and distribute those issues out to team members which we kept track of. As the semester 
  progressed, we were able to communicate what we worked on individually, and make sure that all ideas got achieved by a
  certain date. In order to communicate, our team used discord. On Discord, we created a separate channel, for us to be 
  able to share how far we have gotten so far on our individual tasks for the project. Although we communicated on 
  Discord, we also communicated when we met in person in class. This was essential, because we were able to see what each 
  person had achieved, and look at each other’s code without having to wait for people to merge their changes onto Github.
  We separated these tasks and worked on them in separate branches, which allowed us to be able to merge them onto master. 
  After certain milestones, we were able to communicate with the founders of VolunteerAlly, and figure out what we needed 
  to do in order to meet certain expectations that we needed to achieve in order to make our application fully functional. 
	To begin, our team originally began working on the project together, by making sure that we had the foundations together, and then expanding on certain things, like making our design look nicer, and adding certain features to accommodate those foundations. We added features, such as a map, that allowed users to see where opportunities were close to them, and help them locate any other opportunity. Along with these opportunities, came the organizations, which hosted the opportunities. Our application offered users the ability to find opportunities, based on their interests, and track the amount of hours that they put into their opportunities. Using these features, allows not only the organizations, but also the users the ability to see how well they are doing in terms of volunteering. Not only was this an essential implementation, but also other implementations we had which kept track of collections that stored the information of the organizations, as well as the opportunities. 
	In the application in which we created, we used a MongoDB in order to store all of the entries. We created different 
  collections, for different things, such as the organization collection, the opportunity collection, and the hours 
  collection, which stored different things such as the names, the description of the collection, and so forth. Using 
  these collections were very impactful in the creation of creating our application, and making our application able to 
  work for users, and the owners of the organizations. We also created a feature for the administrator of the application, 
  which allows them to be able to go in and edit certain things in the application, such as deleting an opportunity that 
  no longer exists, and so forth. 
	Overall, I think that this class was very essential, because it helped us learn how to work with others on a particular 
  goal, and find ways to achieve that goal using things like GitHub, and the features GitHub has to offer. 
  It was realistic, and very interesting, and is what I’d imagine an actual project to be like in the real world. 
  I think that not only were we able to learn this new dynamic, but we were also able to learn new ways to use what we 
  learned in 314, in order to help us mitigate through our problems in 414, and be better team members. Although we all 
  worked on different things in our project, we all learned something new and important, and were able to better our 
  understanding on creating a real-world application, and launching it. What I enjoyed the most about this class, was our 
  freedom and ability to be able to learn outside of what the class provided us with, in the modules, and figure out 
  things we needed in order to achieve our tasks. Communicating with our team members also provided us with very useful 
  real-life skills. I think that this class is very helpful for anyone aspiring to be a Software Developer, working in the 
  real world, and provides us with the necessary skills in order to help us achieve working as a developer on a team.
