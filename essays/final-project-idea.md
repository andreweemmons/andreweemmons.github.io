DumpIt!

Overview: 

The problem: Many students will face the problem of earning an "irrelevant" degree, and be left without a job in the desired field they just spent four years putting
effort into, and have a skillset go to waste. Many of those trying to get into certain fields, don't have the required hands-on experience to get their foot into the industry.


The solution: This app will allow students to freelance services to other students. This may include, an art major, 
who collaborates with a musician in order to create a visually appealing product for the world. Another example could include a photography major who 
is willing to take graduation photos for other students. By harnessing what they have learned in college, they can not only take on projects that help them
gain real world experience, but also help connect with other students at UH with similar goals, and desires.

Approach:

To use this application, a student must sign up using their first name, last name, major, university, and e-mail address. Once signed up, a student can post their
services onto the service board, which will be another page, and advertise any sort of projects they choose. Any students registered for this app will be able to see
the projects posted on their service board, and notify the other user if they are interested. They can accept collaborations, or reject collaborations.
This will help students begin freelancing and connect with other students who may have common interests. 

Mockup Page Ideas:

1. Landing Page 
2. Services Page  
3. Profile Page 
4. Edit Profile Page 

Case Ideas: 

1. New User - visits page, signs up, enters information, visits home page. 
2. Admin User - visits page, logs in, is able to see and edit everyones profile. 
3. Existing User - visits page, browses services, maybe posts a service, and waits to connect with other students using the app.

Beyond the basics:

Add features such as a payment system which would allow for users to earn revenue from projects, and/or off campus assistance.
Add features such as a display for users accomplishments which show all the projects they completed, and can help them display their projects for other users to see.
Add features such as an instant delivery system allows for users to send their completed projects, an on going progress to other users.
