As programmers, we often find ourselves in situations where we have to look up certain coding conventions. This is something that is common to us when learning a new programming language, especially being unfamiliar with the syntax. Learning a new programming language isn't easy and can take up a lot of time. Thankfully, coding standards exist which help us eliminate errors and provides us with ways to ultimately write code. Because of this, we are able to learn how to properly write code in the moment. This helps us learn from coding standards, and can save us time from having to look things up on a search engine.

In the last week, we had implemented ESLint and IntelliJ while learning "underscore". ESLint is a coding standard that helps us save time when trying to code in Javascript. ESLint provides us with check boxes, that are red, yellow, or green, and help guide us when programming in Javascript. Red is an error, yellow is like a warning, and green means that you're good to go. It has been very helpful, especially when learning how to use underscore, which we have recently learned how to do. I hope to continue to use ESLint as I continually progress learning how to use Javascript.

Overall, coding standards are very helpful to us as newbie programmers. They provide with feedback as we code, that helps us save time from having to look up how to fix certain issues. They also provide us with ways to keep code in a healthy appearance to other programmers. We started using ESLint with IntelliJ and have been using it as we learn more about JavaScript. This has been very helpful and has been a good way to make sure that everything we are doing is right. It is surely something that I would not want to rely on, but is a great way for us, especially as beginner programmers, to help us learn how to write code.
