Software Engineering has allowed myself to become a better programmer in many ways. To start, I have learned that although much of programming requires us to problem solve and think outside the box, we also must think like those who are using the applications we are developing. This shows that while we are programming, we are writing something that somebody else may use. We must be empathetic as programmers, in order to become better. 

In our class, we learned about the ethics of programming, and the result of programming unethically. In programming, we must follow ethical standards in order to ensure that our clients are safe when using the programs we write, as well as anybody else directly or indirectly affected by the program. We looked at case studies, which were predominantly situations that programmers got themselves into, as well as the consumer, and company by not following these guidelines. These are situations that we can learn from, and use in the real world as future programmers, business owners, and even consumers of products built by other programmers. It is important that we keep our perspective open to everyone who is affected by our program in anyway, as well as affected by us as people.

We also learned about the design of our programming, and how to create a real world application. To make this possible, we used Semantic UI, which is a framework that allows us to easily customize the website we are working on and create a modern day feel to it. Semantic UI allows us to be much more custom, while maintaining a neat responsive web page. It is a framework that allows us to make the website look nice, as well as comfortable for the user. I learned that programming isn't all about just solving problems, it's also about creating something that somebody else will use, and it's up to us to provide comfort to the user. Semantic UI is a framework that allows for us to add many cool features to our website that would be very difficult to do hard coding in HTML and CSS. It is also a way for us to create a professional looking website.

Overall, I would suggest anyone getting into building websites to start looking at UI Frameworks. They help us design, and provide us with many different options when it comes to creating a website. Frameworks also seem to be up to date to help us achieve a more modern look in our websites. Through my experience, frameworks have helped me design web pages that need to look a specific way, and have specific elements added to them. By using grids, containers, and other elements frameworks come with, we can easily achieve a look that we want, and shouldn’t overlook using frameworks at all. All in all, I believe that if you haven’t tried using a framework yet, you should see how many different alternatives they provide, to save yourself some frustration!
