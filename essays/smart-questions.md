Learning how to program is never easy. It requires us to look up a solution to a particular question, that we might feel we only have in mind. To approach this scenario, we can use smart questions to obtain the right feedback. Smart questions are important to us because they help us establish a way to recieve constructive feedback from real engineers with experience. By creating smart questions, we know that we will often get a thoughtful response, when an expert gives us the time of day to do so. When asking stupid questions, we can come accross as ignorant and wasteful to the time of the reader. Smart questions help us figure out things that cannot be figured out on our own.

I found an example of a smart question, and a not-so-smart question on Stack Overflow. I will begin with the smart question! This question is asking how to convert a concept from Java into Javascript. It provides a detailed question, with lines of code to assist. This shows that the question was specific, to which the author of the question managed to put some thought into. The question he was asking was not aimless, and was relevant to all tags supporting it. The response to the smart question was a well thought out answer where they provided multiple solutions with pros and cons. This is helpful not only to the author of the question, but to the readers of it as well.

An example of a not-so-smart question I found seemed to be much less thought out, and something that could easily be figured out on Google. This question demonstrated laziness, and collected negative votes. The question simply asked what "Java Beans" was. The response, showed a careless response back to the user, with only a link that took us users to the Wikipedia page, "Java Beans". In conclusion, it is important that when asking questions to other developers, we have done our research and have a meaningful question that can be solved, that not only benefits us as authors of the question, but to the user, and to the responders insight.
