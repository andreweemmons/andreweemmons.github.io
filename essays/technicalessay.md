To begin, software engineering is something that is not so foreign to me. Growing up in a household where both of my parents had degrees in Computer Science, it almost felt as if it was a no-brainer to pursue. The first time I learned how to code was in CSS and HTML. I was learning on a website called teamtreehouse.com where it was done in a step by step process. The first time I learned how to write, "Hello World" to a computer, was facinating and mind blowing that I could create something with only a few lines of code.

As of last summer (summer 2019), I had received my first ever opportunity to have a paid client contract me to build a website. The website, called tukah24.com, was for an election that was taking place in Hawaii. This election was important because there are 50,000 Koreans in the Korean community here, and they were voting for a new President, of the Korean Association. The project enabled myself to learn how to write code not only in HTML and CSS, but also in PHP and MySQL. By the time I completed the project, I discovered a facination with building and maintaining websites. There was something creative, but also technical about it that enlightened me. 

I hope to continue my journey as a programmer at UH Manoa, and learn much more about web development. I know that a lot of the courses here go over topics that aren't so related, but even that is also mind-expanding! The skills that we learn in this class have involved JavaScript, which is also something that can be applied to web development! All in all, I hope to pursue a career in full-stack web development, and learn much of the required skills in the UH Manoa cirriculum.
